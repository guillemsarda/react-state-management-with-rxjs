# react-state-management-with-rxjs

This is a simple example on how to build a state management tool in React using `BehaviorSubject` from `rxjs`.
Following a Redux-like syntax, you can now create multiple states that will be handled automatically. More documentation will come soon.


To run it you only have to access the root directory and run:

- `npm i` to install all the dependencies*.
- `npm start` to run the app in the browser.

PS: I initially built this with [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-state-management-with-behaviorsubject-j3oqbi).

\* If it throws an error when installing, run `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`, instead.
