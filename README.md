# react-state-management-with-rxjs

This is a simple example on how to build a state management tool in React using `BehaviorSubject` from `rxjs`. 

**I used this great article https://isamatov.com/react-rxjs-shared-state/ to polish some things that I wasn't doing properly when subscribing.**

To run it you only have to access the root directory and run:

- `npm i` to install all the dependencies.
- `npm start` to run the app in the browser.
